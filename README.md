# Educational-Platform
Globally accessible educational platform

# Front-End:
## 1. Overview
The front-end of the global educational platform is a Single Page Application (SPA), hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed globally using Amazon CloudFront. The platform is designed for minimal latency and high availability for users across regions such as Saudi Arabia and the United States. The Amazon Route 53 service is used for DNS management and routing traffic efficiently.

- SPA (React or Svelte).
- S3: Stores static website files.
- CloudFront: Distributes content globally with caching at edge locations.
- Route 53: Manages custom DNS for the website domain name.
- ACM: Secures communication over HTTPS.
- IAM: Access & security of resources.

## 2. Front-End Deployment Components
### 2.1. S3 for Static Website Hosting
- S3 Storage: Stores the SPA and related static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
- Scalable: S3 automatically scales to handle growing content and user traffic.
- Public Access: S3 is configured with public read permissions for static assets, which are cached via CloudFront.
### 2.2. CloudFront for Global Content Delivery
- Global Caching: CloudFront caches content at edge locations, reducing latency by serving assets from the nearest region (e.g., Bahrain for Saudi users, U.S. East for U.S. users).
- Fast Delivery: Static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript are delivered quickly via CloudFrontâ€™s CDN.
- Cache Control: Custom caching policies are applied to optimize delivery speeds while ensuring freshness of content.
### 2.3. Route 53 for DNS Management
- DNS Routing: Route 53 maps the domain name (e.g., www.domain-name.com) to the CloudFront distribution.
- Latency-Based Routing: Automatically routes users to the nearest CloudFront edge location to minimize load times and improve performance.
### 2.4. ACM for HTTPS Encryption
- SSL/TLS: SSL certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) ensure secure HTTPS communication between users and CloudFront, protecting user data during transmission.
